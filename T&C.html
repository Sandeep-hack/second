Payments once made are Non Refundable<br>

Effective Date June 4 2021<br><br>
Refund Policy<br>
Effective as of January 1, 2020.<br>

For details on our refund deadlines and policies, please refer to the information below. Please note that our policies differ between one-time payments made for course, Specialization, and Live project purchases, and that payment options may vary from one Service to another. Please also note that we treat violations of our Terms of Use and Honor Code very seriously, and we have no obligation to offer refunds to users who violate these terms, even if their requests are made within the designated refund period. Similarly, we have no obligation to offer late refunds to users who do not receive a passing mark in the Content Offering, or who are otherwise unsatisfied with their final grade.<br>

For Course Certificate and Specialization Purchases
If you cancel your paid enrollment for a standalone course, Dhaka will offer you a complete refund within 30 minutes after payment, or until you have not started your Course, whichever is earlier. If you pre-enroll and pay for a course, Dhaka will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after the course launches or until you have earned your Course Certificate, whichever is earlier. For avoidance doubt, once you have earned a Course Certificate with your payment, you are not eligible for a refund even if it is within 14 days. If you do not earn your Course Certificate within 180 days, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for the course. <br>

For Live Projects<br>
Dhaka does not offer refunds for payments made for Live projects. If you do not earn your completion certificate within 180 days after registering for a Live project, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for the Live project in order to complete the Live project and earn your completion certificate. If you have subscribed through a third party marketplace that restricts Dhaka's ability to issue refunds -- e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store, please visit the third party marketplace for information regarding their policies.<br>


For Other Paid Services<br>
Except as described in this Refund Policy or as explicitly stated as part of the sign-up process for a Service, Dhaka has no obligation to provide refunds or vouchers for any other Services.<br>

Third Party Marketplaces<br>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you purchase or subscribe for a course, Specialization, Live project, or purchase any other paid Service, through a third party marketplace (e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store or purchases made through certain alternative payment services), the refund policy applicable to that third party marketplace will apply, unless otherwise explicitly stated by Dhaka. Except as otherwise explicitly stated by Dhaka, the third party marketplace will be solely responsible for making refunds under its refund policy, and Dhaka will have no refund obligations. Dhaka disclaims any responsibility or liability related to any third party marketplace's refund policy or the third party's compliance or noncompliance with such policy.<br>

Honor Code<br>
Effective as of January 1, 2020<br><br>

All students participating in the class must agree to abide by the following code:
I will register for only one account, unless expressly permitted to register for additional accounts by Dhaka.
My answers to homework, quizzes, exams, projects, and other assignments will be my own work (except for assignments that explicitly permit collaboration).
I will not make solutions to homework, quizzes, exams, projects, and other assignments available to anyone else (except to the extent an assignment explicitly permits sharing solutions). This includes both solutions written by me, as well as any solutions provided by the course staff or others.
I will not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve my results or dishonestly improve or hurt the results of others.<br>
